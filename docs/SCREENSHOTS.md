# Screenshots

Placeholder descriptions until we can capture assets locally:

1. **Feed view** – shows offer cards, join actions, and news sidebar.
2. **Map view** – Leaflet map with hazard circles + reporting form.
3. **Chat view** – Active offer chat with Socket.IO stream.

Use your OS screenshot tool after running `make dev` and drop PNGs inside this folder for judging.
